// printf: This is a function in C used for printing or displaying information on the screen.

// "%d": This is a format specifier. It tells printf how to interpret the data it's given. In this case, %d is used for integers (whole numbers).

// 12: This is the actual data you want to print. Here, it's the number 12.

// So, when you write printf("%d", 12);, it tells the computer to print the integer 12 on the screen.

// Note that this line contains a (;) semicolon at the end. Semicolon is mandatory at the end of statements in C.
